# Simple Email Sharing - No Configuration Needed!

Instead of complex SMTP/OAuth setup, the application now uses **mailto links** that open your default email client (Gmail, Outlook, etc.) with pre-filled content.

## How It Works

When you click "Send Email" or "Share via Email":
1. A mailto link opens your default email application
2. The email is pre-filled with:
   - Recipients (if you entered them)
   - Subject line
   - Body content (meeting details, agenda, etc.)
3. You can review and edit before sending
4. Click Send in your email client

## Benefits

✅ **No configuration needed** - Works immediately  
✅ **No credentials required** - Uses your existing email  
✅ **Full control** - Review before sending  
✅ **Works with any email** - Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, etc.  
✅ **Secure** - No passwords stored in the app  

## How to Use

### From Meeting Dashboard:
1. Click "Email Report" button on any meeting
2. Enter recipient email addresses (comma-separated)
3. Click "Open in Email Client"
4. Your email app opens with pre-filled content
5. Review and click Send

### From Agenda/Minutes/Reports Pages:
1. Click the "Share via Email" button
2. Enter recipients
3. Click "Open in Email Client"
4. Review and send from your email app

## Supported Email Clients

- Gmail (web and app)
- Outlook (web and app)
- Apple Mail
- Thunderbird
- Yahoo Mail
- Any default email client on your device

## Tips

- **Multiple recipients**: Separate emails with commas: `user1@example.com, user2@example.com`
- **Mobile devices**: Works on phones and tablets too
- **Attachments**: You can add attachments manually in your email client
- **Formatting**: Edit the email content before sending if needed

## Limitations

- Cannot send emails automatically (you must click Send)
- Cannot schedule emails
- Cannot track if emails were sent
- Large content may be truncated on some email clients
