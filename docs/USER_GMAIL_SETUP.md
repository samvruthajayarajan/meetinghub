## Why Do I See This Warning?

Google shows this warning for apps that haven't completed their verification process. The app is safe to use - the developer just hasn't paid for Google's verification badge (costs $15-$75).

## Is It Safe?

Yes! The app only requests permission to:
- Send emails on your behalf
- Access your email address

It cannot:
- Read your emails
- Delete your emails
- Access your contacts
- Access any other Google services

## What If I Don't Want to Connect Gmail?

You have other options:
1. Use SMTP configuration (enter your email server settings)
2. Ask your admin to configure a shared email service

## Troubleshooting

### I don't see the "Advanced" button
- Make sure you're on the warning screen (not the sign-in screen)
- Try using a different browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)

### I get "Error 400: invalid_request"
- Contact your MeetingHub administrator
- The app's redirect URI may need to be updated

### I get "Error 403: access_denied"
- Contact your MeetingHub administrator
- The app may still be in testing mode and needs to be published
